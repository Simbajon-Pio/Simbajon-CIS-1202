    <p style="font-size: 30px;"><i>I have known you for a very long time since we came out of our mothers womb together. I know we may have our differences but all of those differences, the face is our only similarities.
    Just kidding, we are <strong>practically one person</strong> if we go together everywhere. <br>But to be honest, I think I cannot live properly without you in my life. You are with me through
<sup>ups</sup> and <sub>downs.</sub>Even how <small>small</small> your efforts is, it is always appreciated. <mark>Thank you very much.</mark>
